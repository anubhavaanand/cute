can we create our own linux terminal?
i want to improve the output representation and as if more transparent and interactive , and the the terminal window to be more interactive and more thought of and maybe more toward poer users
expalin how are you plainning on implementing 7th , also find pul real and accurate info on how does the commands gets executed like for a sudo pacman command does the sudo commaand travels mto a sudo dir or some file then after accepting then travels to the pacman dir , then to the internet actual traansparent hole monitored and accurate output journey to represent it more graphically and in a thoughful manner maybe for all time terminal users who are experts

i dont wan tit to generate a subprocess but in the same terminal in agraphical and professional way and dont wanna give it much space , what reppresentation way youy think should be implemented here ,
were only planning rn also not like that representation i want something like , a web or sting getiing from the sudo then getiing to the file then copleting access then the sudo web gets oin the pacman the to the file then to internet , do you ubnderstand what im trying to tell you or i should have more , information, however you ideas arent all bad, i want the command writing woindo to have a graphical wallpaper not sttatic but auto custom to weather
I start with technical research for weather-based backgrounds? also research about our representation , it is all that wil matter , als research on how to make it most lightweight as possible and what language oer stack to consider
